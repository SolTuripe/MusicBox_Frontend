# Music Box FrontEnd 📻

This project is part of a hackathon that took place on february 16 and 17 \
We have to create a marketplace with the minimum viable product:

- A home page with a list of all ads
- A show page that shows more information about the ad

In this repository we create the User Interface for our Music Box marketplace \
[You can access the back of Music Box here](https://github.com/SolTuripe/musicbox-backend)

## Project Setup 📌

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

We use React, a Javascript library that can build user interface components.
These componentes are reusable bits of code made with JavaScript and HTML.
CSS is included to make the style of the web.

The project also has the following dependecies:

    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.2",
    "@testing-library/react": "^12.1.3",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "axios": "^0.26.0",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-icons": "^4.3.1",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.2.1",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.0",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
